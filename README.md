# Hourly Foxes VRC
This is the source code for the [Hourly Foxes VRC](https://vrc.group/FOXES.5781) group I run on my VRChat account!

## Running
1. **Make sure your account has an active VRChat Plus subscription**
2. Run the program and login with your username and password (and 2fa if needed)
3. Input a group ID you have posting perms for
4. Enjoy the foxes!

## To do
- [ ] Sort functions into different classes / files
- [ ] Make a config class that holds all the configuration info instead of using like 5 text tiles
- [ ] Add arguments for more command line control
- [ ] Find a way to let non VRC+ users upload images (maybe using a avatar preview image instead of a gallery image would work?)
